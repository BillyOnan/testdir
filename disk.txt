Running the command ls /dev/sd* will now return a new entry.
 Create one partition on new disk, example to sdx:                                                                                                                                                                                                            fdisk /dev/sdx

Create an ext3 file system on the new disk partition created on step 11.

mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdx1

Caution: Ensure you have selected the right device, there is no undo.
 
Run the fdisk command to verify the existence of the new disk partition you created:

fdisk -l

Run this command to create a mount point for the new disk partition:

mkdir /New_Directory_Name
 
Run this command to display the current content of /etc/fstab:
cat /etc/fstab
Using a text editor, edit fstab and add this line to add the disk partition to /etc/fstab so that it is available across reboots:
/dev/sdx1 /New_Directory_Name ext3 defaults 1 3
Note: Use a Linux text editor of your choice.
Restart the Linux virtual machine and the new disk partition is now available.
